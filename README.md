# SoftwareSecurity

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a professional financial consultant firm that designs financial plans for their clients. Artemis Financial hired us to ensure that their web application was secure since it handles very sensitive information on the client and the server side.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  Using what I have learned in software security I have identified seurity concerns through manually looking over code and static testing. It is important to code securely because that it is the first layer of security that needs to be established. Software Security can make or break a company if it is good or bad.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  The maven dependency tool is a useful tool although it was a little confusing to get to work.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

  I approached the need to increase layers of security by running multiple tests and checks. In the future penetration testing should be included.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I ensured code was functional by runnning constant tests each time anything was changed. I also ran maven dependency check multiple times to check for vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  The meain tool that I used in this project was maven dependency check although I am not likely to use it again in practical applications until I get a better grasp on how to properly use it. I also learned much about better coding practices and how to code securely that will definitely be implemented in my future code.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  I believe in this assignment I made a clear and easy to understand document outlining the initial security assessment and what I believed the code needed to be secure and successful.
